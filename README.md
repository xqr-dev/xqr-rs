# XQR-RS: eXtended Quick Response (XQR) Codes Library

Welcome to XQR-RS, a Rust library that enables secure encoding and decoding of QR codes using JWT and JWKs. 
This project aims to enhance the security of traditional QR codes by incorporating cryptographic keys, providing a robust solution for verifying QR codes and preventing tampering.

## Repositories
- **XQR-RS Library**: [github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-rs](https://github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-rs)
- **XQR-CLI**: [github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-cli](https://github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-cli)

## Inspiration
The idea for this project was inspired by the following research paper:

_R. Focardi, F. L. Luccio and H. A. M. Wahsheh, "Usable cryptographic QR codes," 2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT), Lyon, France, 2018, pp. 1664-1669, doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2018.8352431._

## Overview

### XQR-RS Library
The core library, hosted in this repository, provides the underlying functionality for encoding and decoding QR codes with extended security features. It includes methods for handling cryptographic keys, token generation, verification, and more.

### XQR-CLI
The CLI tool allows users to interact with the XQR-RS library from the command line. Users can encode and decode XQR codes, generate QR images, and perform various other operations with ease. For more details, please visit the [XQR-CLI repository](https://github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-cli).

## Getting Started
Detailed documentation and examples will be provided soon. Stay tuned for updates.
